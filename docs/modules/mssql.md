Open Service Broker for Azure contains three Azure SQL Database services. These services enable you to select the most appropriate provision scenario for your needs. These services are:

| Service Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `azure-sql` | Provision both a SQL Server DBMS and a database. |
| `azure-sql-dbms-only` | Provision only a SQL Server Database Management System (DBMS). This can be used to provision multiple databases at a later time. |
| `azure-sql-db-only` | Provision a new database only upon a previously provisioned DBMS. |

The `azure-sql` service allows you to provision both a DBMS and a database. This service is ready to use upon successful provisioning. You can not provision additional databases onto an instance provisioned through this service. The `azure-sql-dbms-only` and `azure-sql-db-only` services, on the other hand, can be combined to provision multiple databases on a single DBMS.  For more information on each service, refer to the descriptions below.

| Parameter Name | Type | Description | Required | Default Value |
|----------------|------|-------------|----------|---------------|

| `resourceGroup` | `string` | The (new or existing) resource group with which to associate new resources. | N | If an administrator has configured the broker itself with a default resource group and none is specified, that default will be applied, otherwise, a new resource group will be created with a UUID as its name. |
| `tags` | `map[string]string` | Tags to be applied to new resources, specified as key/value pairs. | N | Tags (even if none are specified) are automatically supplemented with `heritage: open-service-broker-azure`. |

Binding returns the following connection details and credentials:
