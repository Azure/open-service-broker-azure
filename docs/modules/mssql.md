# [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/)

_Note: this module is PREVIEW. It is under moderate development, but future releases may still break the API._

Open Service Broker for Azure (OSBA) contains three Azure SQL Database services. These services enable you to select the most appropriate provisioning scenario for your needs. These services are:

| Service Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `azure-sql` | Provision both a SQL Server DBMS and a database. |
| `azure-sql-dbms` | Provision only a SQL Server Database Management System (DBMS). This can be used to provision multiple databases at a later time. |
| `azure-sql-database` | Provision a new database only upon a previously provisioned DBMS. |

The `azure-sql` service allows you to provision both a DBMS and a database. When the provision operation is successful, the database will be ready to use. You can not provision additional databases onto an instance provisioned through this service. The `azure-sql-dbms` and `azure-sql-database` services, on the other hand, can be combined to provision multiple databases on a single DBMS.  For more information on each service, refer to the descriptions below.

##### Examples

###### Kubernetes

The `contrib/k8s/examples/sql/sql-instance.yaml` can be used to provision one of the plans from the all-in-one `azure-sql` service. This can be done with the following example:

```console
kubectl create -f ../../contrib/k8s/examples/sql/sql-instance.yaml
```

You can then create a binding to the service with the following command:

```console
kubectl create -f ../../contrib/k8s/examples/sql/sql-binding.yaml
```

###### Cloud Foundry

Using the `cf` cli, you can create the `basic` plan of the `azure-sql` service with the following command:

```console
cf create-service azure-sql basic azure-sql-all-in-one -c '{
        "resourceGroup" : "demo",
        "location" : "eastus",
        "firewallRules" : [
            {
                "name": "AllowAll",
                "startIPAddress": "0.0.0.0",
                "endIPAddress" : "255.255.255.255"
            }
        ]
    }
'
```

###### cURL

Assuming your OSBA is running locally on port 8080 with the default username and password, you can provision the all-in-one Azure SQL Database service with a cURL command similar to the following example:

```console
curl -X PUT \
  'http://localhost:8080/v2/service_instances/azure-sql-database?accepts_incomplete=true' \
  -H 'authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-broker-api-version: 2.13' \
  -d '{
    "service_id" : "fb9bc99e-0aa9-11e6-8a8a-000d3a002ed5",
    "plan_id" : "17725188-76a2-4d6c-8e86-49f146766eeb",
    "parameters" : {
        "resourceGroup" : "demo",
        "location" : "eastus",
        "firewallRules" : [
            {
                "name": "AllowAll",
                "startIPAddress": "0.0.0.0",
                "endIPAddress" : "255.255.255.255"
            }
        ]
    }
}'
```

### Service: azure-sql-dbms

| Plan Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `dbms` | Azure SQL Server DBMS-Only |

###### Provisioning Parameters

| Parameter Name | Type | Description | Required | Default Value |
|----------------|------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| `location` | `string` | The Azure region in which to provision applicable resources. | Required _unless_ an administrator has configured the broker itself with a default location. | The broker's default location, if configured. |
| `resourceGroup` | `string` | The (new or existing) resource group with which to associate new resources. | N | If an administrator has configured the broker itself with a default resource group and none is specified, that default will be applied, otherwise, a new resource group will be created with a UUID as its name. |

##### Unbind

This service is not bindable.

##### Deprovision

Deprovision will delete the SQL Server DBMS. If any databases have been provisioned on this DBMS, deprovisioning will be deferred until all databases have been deprovisioned.

##### Examples

###### Kubernetes

The `contrib/k8s/examples/sql/advanced/sql-dbms-instance.yaml` can be used to provision one of the plans from the all-in-one `azure-sql-dbms` service. This can be done with the following example:

```console
kubectl create -f ../../contrib/k8s/examples/sql/advanced/sql-dbms-instance.yaml
```

###### Cloud Foundry

Using the `cf` cli, you can create the `dbms` plan of the `azure-sql-dbms` service with the following command:

```console
cf create-service azure-sql-dbms dbms azure-sql-dbms -c '{
        "resourceGroup" : "demo",
        "location" : "eastus",
        "alias" : "ed9798f2-2e91-4b21-8903-d364a3ff7d12",
        "firewallRules" : [
            {
                "name": "AllowAll",
                "startIPAddress": "0.0.0.0",
                "endIPAddress" : "255.255.255.255"
            }
        ]
    }
'
```

###### cURL

To provision an instance using the broker directly, you must use the ID for both plan and service. Assuming your OSBA is running locally on port 8080 with the default username and password, you can provision the DBMS-only Azure SQL Database service with a cURL command similar to the following example. This example illustrates multiple firewall rules and provides an alias for later database provisioning:

```console
curl -X PUT \
  'http://localhost:8080/v2/service_instances/sql-dbms?accepts_incomplete=true' \
  -H 'authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-broker-api-version: 2.13' \
  -d '{
    "service_id" : "a7454e0e-be2c-46ac-b55f-8c4278117525",
    "plan_id" : "24f0f42e-1ab3-474e-a5ca-b943b2c48eee",
    "parameters" : {
        "resourceGroup": "demo",
        "location" : "eastus",
        "alias" : "7ce1fc7d-073a-4be6-abe6-536e7053496d",
        "firewallRules" : [
            {
                "name": "AllowSome",
                "startIPAddress": "0.0.0.0",
                "endIPAddress" : "35.0.0.0"
            },
            {
                "name": "AllowMore",
                "startIPAddress": "35.0.0.1",
                "endIPAddress" : "255.255.255.255"
            }
        ]
    }
}'
```

###### Binding Parameters

This binding operation does not support any parameters.

###### Credentials

Binding returns the following connection details and credentials:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `host` | `string` | The fully-qualified address of the SQL Server. |
| `port` | `int` | The port number to connect to on the SQL Server. |

| `encrypt` | `boolean` | Flag indicating if the connection should be encrypted. |
| `tags` | `string[]` | List of tags. |

##### Unbind

Drops the applicable user from the SQL Server.

##### Deprovision

Deletes the database from the SQL Server instance, but does not delete the DBMS.

##### Examples

###### Kubernetes

The `contrib/k8s/examples/sql/advanced/sql-database-instance.yaml` can be used to provision the `basic` plan. This can be done with the following example:

```console
kubectl create -f ../../contrib/k8s/examples/sql/advanced/sql-database-instance.yaml
```
You can then create a binding with the following command:

```console
kubectl create -f ../../contrib/k8s/examples/sql/advanced/sql-database-binding.yaml
```

###### Cloud Foundry

Using the `cf` cli, you can create the `basic` plan of the `azure-sql-database` service with the following command:

```console
cf create-service azure-sql-database basic azure-sql-database -c '{
    "parentAlias" : "ed9798f2-2e91-4b21-8903-d364a3ff7d12"
}'
```

Note: this uses the alias used when provisioning the DBMS-only service above.

###### cURL

To provision an instance using the broker directly, you must use the ID for both plan and service. Assuming your OSBA is running locally on port 8080 with the default username and password, you can provision the `database` plan onto a previously provisioned Azure SQL Database DBMS with a cURL command similar to the following example. Note, this uses the alias provided in the DBMS-only example above:

```console
curl -X PUT \
  'http://localhost:8080/v2/service_instances/sql-database?accepts_incomplete=true' \
  -H 'authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-broker-api-version: 2.13' \
  -d '
