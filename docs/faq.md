## OSBA Pod in CrashLoopBackOff, can't lookup osba-redis

```console
$ kubectl get pod -n osba
NAME                                              READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
osba-open-service-broker-azure-7d7f455b79-c69v8   0/1       CrashLoopBackOff   15         53m
osba-redis-59656f567c-497dl                       1/1       Running            0          16m

$ kubectl logs osba-open-service-broker-azure-7d7f455b79-c69v8 -n osba

```

After checking on the health of the kube-system pods, kube-dns was not working. This caused osba 
to be unable to connect to its Redis instance. The problem was resolved by deleting the
kube-dns pods, so that Kubernetes would recreate them.

## I don't see all the services

Open Service Broker for Azure provides a number of services and each of these services is implemented by a separate module. The stability of individual modules is independent of overall broker stability and is ranked on a scale of `experimental`, `preview`, and `stable`. The broker can be configured to only load modules at or above a specified stability threshold. By default, the helm chart configures the broker to only load modules that are marked as `preview` or `stable`. This currently includes Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL and Azure SQL Database. If you would like to use other services, you will need to add an additional flag to your helm install command:

```console
helm install azure/open-service-broker-azure --name osba --namespace osba \
  --set azure.subscriptionId=$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
  --set azure.tenantId=$AZURE_TENANT_ID \
  --set azure.clientId=$AZURE_CLIENT_ID \
  --set azure.clientSecret=$AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET \
  --set modules.minStability=EXPERIMENTAL
```
