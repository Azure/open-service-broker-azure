## Quickstarts

Go from "_I have an Azure account that I have never used_" to "_I just deployed WordPress and know what OSBA means!_"

* The [Minikube Quickstart](docs/quickstart-minikube.md) walks through using the
  Open Service Broker for Azure to deploy WordPress on a local Minikube cluster.

## Getting Started on Kubernetes

### Installing

#### Prerequisites

You'll need a few prerequisites before you run these examples on Kubernetes.
Instructions on how to install each prerequisite are linked below:

- [A compatible Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/Azure/helm-charts/blob/master/docs/prerequisities/README.md#step-1-create-a-compatible-kubernetes-cluster)
- [A working Helm installation](https://github.com/Azure/helm-charts/blob/master/docs/prerequisities/README.md#step-2-initialize-helm-on-the-cluster)
- [Service Catalog](https://github.com/Azure/helm-charts/blob/master/docs/prerequisities/README.md#step-3-install-service-catalog)
- [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm)

#### Service Catalog CLI

Once you've installed the prerequisites, you'll need the Service Catalog CLI, svcat,
installed to introspect the Kubernetes cluster. Please refer to the
[CLI installation instructions](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog/blob/master/docs/install.md#installing-the-service-catalog-cli)
for details on how to install it onto your machine.

#### Helm Chart

Use [Helm](https://helm.sh) to install Open Service Broker for Azure onto your Kubernetes
cluster. Refer to the OSBA [Helm chart](https://github.com/Azure/open-service-broker-azure/tree/master/contrib/k8s/charts/open-service-broker-azure)
for details on how to complete the installation.

#### OpenShift Project Template

Deploy OSBA using a OpenShift Project Template
- You must have Service Catalog already installed on OpenShift in order for this to work

Create a new OpenShift project

```console
oc new-project osba
```

Process the OpenShift Template

```console
oc process -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/open-service-broker-azure/master/contrib/openshift/osba-os-template.yaml  \
   -p ENVIRONMENT=AzurePublicCloud \
   -p AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
   -p AZURE_TENANT_ID=$AZURE_TENANT_ID \
   -p AZURE_CLIENT_ID=$AZURE_CLIENT_ID \
   -p AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=$AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET \
   | oc create -f -
```
### Provisioning

With the Kubernetes Service Catalog software and Open Service Broker for Azure both
installed on your Kubernetes cluster, try creating a `ServiceInstance` resource
to see service provisioning in action.

The following will provision PostgreSQL on Azure:

```console
$ kubectl create -f contrib/k8s/examples/postgresql/postgresql-instance.yaml
```

After the `ServiceInstance` resource is submitted, you can view its status:

```console
$ svcat get instance example-postgresql-all-in-one-instance
```

You'll see output that includes a status indicating that asynchronous
provisioning is ongoing. Eventually, that status will change to indicate
that asynchronous provisioning is complete.

### Binding

Upon provision success, bind to the instance:

```console
$ kubectl create -f contrib/k8s/examples/postgresql/postgresql-binding.yaml
```

To check the status of the binding:

```console
$ svcat get binding example-postgresql-all-in-one-binding
```

You'll see some output indicating that the binding was successful. Once it is,
a secret named `my-postgresql-secret` will be written that contains the database
connection details in it. You can observe that this secret exists and has been
populated:

```console
$ kubectl get secret example-postgresql-all-in-one-secret -o yaml
```

This secret can be used just as any other.

### Unbinding

To unbind:

```console
$ kubectl delete servicebinding my-postgresqldb-binding
```

Observe that the secret named `my-postgresqldb-secret` is also deleted:

```console
$ kubectl get secret my-postgresqldb-secret
Error from server (NotFound): secrets "my-postgresqldb-secret" not found
```

### Deprovisioning

To deprovision:

```console
$ kubectl delete serviceinstance my-postgresqldb-instance
```

You can observe the status to see that asynchronous deprovisioning is ongoing:

```console
$ svcat get instance my-postgresqldb-instance
```

## Getting Started on Cloud Foundry

### Installing

To deploy Open Service Broker for Azure to Cloud Foundry, please refer to the
[CloudFoundry installation documentation](contrib/cf/README.md) for instructions.

### Provisioning

The following will create a Postgres service:

```console
cf create-service azure-postgresql-9-6 basic50 mypostgresdb -c '{
  "location": "eastus",
  "resourceGroup": "test",
  "firewallRules" : [
      {
        "name": "AllowAll",
        "startIPAddress": "0.0.0.0",
        "endIPAddress" : "255.255.255.255"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

You can check the status of the service instance using the `cf service` command,
which will show output similar to the following:

```console
Service instance: mypostgresdb
Service: azure-postgresqldb
Bound apps:
Tags:
Plan: basic50
Description: Azure Database for PostgreSQL Service
Documentation url:
Dashboard:

Last Operation
Status: create in progress
Message: Creating server uf666164eb31.
Started: 2017-10-17T23:30:07Z
Updated: 2017-10-17T23:30:12Z
```

### Binding

Once the service has been successfully provisioned, you can bind to it by using
`cf bind-service` or by including it in a Cloud Foundry manifest.

```console
cf bind-service myapp mypostgresdb
```

Once bound, the connection details for the service (such as its endpoint and
authentication credentials) are available from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment
variable within the application. You can view the environment variables for a
given application using the `cf env` command:

```console
cf env myapp
```

### Unbinding

To unbind a service from an application, use the cf unbind-service command:

```console
cf unbind-service myapp mypostgresdb
```

### Deprovisioning

To deprovision the service, use the `cf delete-service` command.

```console
cf delete-service mypostgresdb
```
