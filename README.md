# Quickstart
The [Minikube Quickstart](docs/quickstart-minikube.md) walks-through using the
Open Service Broker for Azure to deploy WordPress on a local Minikube cluster.
Go from "_I have an Azure account that I have never used_" to "_I just deployed WordPress and know what OSBA means!_" ï¿½

## Getting Started on Kubernetes

### Installing

[Helm](https://helm.sh) is used to install Open Service Broker for Azure onto Kubernetes
clusters. Please refer to the
[Helm chart](https://github.com/Azure/helm-charts/tree/master/open-service-broker-azure)
for details on how to complete the installation.

### Examples

#### Provisioning

With the Kubernetes Service Catalog software and Open Service Broker for Azure both
installed on your Kubernetes cluster, try creating a `ServiceInstance` resource
to see service provisioning in action.

The following will provision PostgreSQL on Azure:

```console
$ kubectl create -f contrib/k8s/examples/postgresql-instance.yaml
```

After the `ServiceInstance` resource is submitted, you can view its status:

```console
$ kubectl get serviceinstance my-postgresql-instance -o yaml
```

The folowing is excerpted from the output and shows that asynchronous
provisioning is ongoing:

```console
status:
  asyncOpInProgress: true
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: 2017-10-16T18:28:13Z
    message: The instance is being provisioned asynchronously
    reason: Provisioning
    status: "False"
    type: Ready
  currentOperation: Provision
  inProgressProperties:
    externalClusterServicePlanName: basic50
    parameterChecksum: bf5f464a1a09117e100c9a7bb10409e57570f281d756aab4cd00b428c7be16ac
    parameters:
      location: eastus
      resourceGroup: demo
  lastOperation: provisioning
  operationStartTime: 2017-10-16T18:28:13Z
```

Eventually, status will reflect a success or failure state:

```console
status:
  asyncOpInProgress: false
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: 2017-10-16T18:36:43Z
    message: The instance was provisioned successfully
    reason: ProvisionedSuccessfully
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
  externalProperties:
    externalClusterServicePlanName: basic50
    parameterChecksum: bf5f464a1a09117e100c9a7bb10409e57570f281d756aab4cd00b428c7be16ac
    parameters:
      location: eastus
      resourceGroup: demo
  orphanMitigationInProgress: false
  reconciledGeneration: 1
```

#### Binding

Upon success, bind to the instance:

```console
$ kubectl create -f contrib/k8s/examples/postgresql-binding.yaml
```

To check the status of the binding:

```console
$ kubectl get servicebinding my-postgresql-binding -o yaml
```

The following is excerpted from the output:

```console
spec:
  externalID: 25638746-bd86-44a1-a60e-06069734f2cd
  instanceRef:
    name: my-postgresql-instance
  secretName: my-postgresql-secret
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: 2017-10-16T18:44:38Z
    message: Injected bind result
    reason: InjectedBindResult
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
  externalProperties: {}
  orphanMitigationInProgress: false
  reconciledGeneration: 1
```

The status shows the binding was successful and the `spec.secretName` field
indicates that connection details and credentials have been written into a
secret named `my-postgresql-secret`. You can observe that this secret exists
and has been populated:

```console
$ kubectl get secret my-postgresql-secret -o yaml
```

This secret can be used just as any other.

#### Unbinding

To unbind:

```console
$ kubectl delete servicebinding my-postgresql-binding
```

Observe that the secret named `my-postgresql-secret` is also deleted:

```console
$ kubectl get secret my-postgresql-secret
Error from server (NotFound): secrets "my-postgresql-secret" not found
```

#### Deprovisioning

To deprovision:

```console
$ kubectl delete serviceinstance my-postgresql-instance
```

You can observe the status to see that asynchronous deprovisioning is ongoing:

```console
$ kubectl get serviceinstance my-postgresql-instance -o yaml
```

The following is excerpted from the output:

```console
status:
  asyncOpInProgress: true
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: 2017-10-16T19:02:19Z
    message: The instance is being deprovisioned asynchronously
    reason: Deprovisioning
    status: "False"
    type: Ready
  currentOperation: Deprovision
  externalProperties:
    externalClusterServicePlanName: basic50
    parameterChecksum: bf5f464a1a09117e100c9a7bb10409e57570f281d756aab4cd00b428c7be16ac
    parameters:
      location: eastus
      resourceGroup: demo
  lastOperation: deprovisioning
  operationStartTime: 2017-10-16T19:02:19Z
  orphanMitigationInProgress: false
  reconciledGeneration: 1
```

When the asynchronous deprovisioning procress completes, the deletion of the
resource will also be complete:

```console
$ kubectl get serviceinstance my-postgresql-instance
Error from server (NotFound): serviceinstances.servicecatalog.k8s.io "my-postgresql-instance" not found
```

## Getting Started on Cloud Foundry

### Installation

To deploy Open Service Broker for Azure to Cloud Foundry, please refer to the 
[CloudFoundry installation documentation](contrib/cf/README.md) for instructions.

### Usage

#### Provisioning

The following will create a Postgres service:

```console
cf create-service azure-postgresqldb basic50 mypostgresdb -c '{"location": "westus2"}'
```

You can check the status of the service instance using the `cf service` command, which will show output similar to the following:

```console
Service instance: mypostgresdb                    
Service: azure-postgresqldb                       
Bound apps:                                       
Tags:                                             
Plan: basic50                                     
Description: Azure Database for PostgreSQL Service
Documentation url:                                
Dashboard:                                        

Last Operation                                    
Status: create in progress                        
Message: Creating server uf666164eb31.            
Started: 2017-10-17T23:30:07Z                     
Updated: 2017-10-17T23:30:12Z                     
```

### Binding

Once the service has been successfully provisioned, you can bind to it, either using `cf bind-service` or by including it in a Cloud Foundry manifest.

```console
cf bind-service myapp mypostgresdb
```

Once bound, the connection details for the service (such as its endpoint and authentication credentaials) are available from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable within the application. You can view the environment variables for a given application using the `cf env` command:

```console
cf env myapp
```

### Unbinding

To unbind a service from an application, use the cf unbind-service command:

```console
cf unbind-service myapp mypostgresdb
```

### Deprovisioning

To deprovision the service, use the `cf delete-service` command.

```console
cf delete-service mypostgresdb
```
