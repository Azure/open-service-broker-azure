      # This is a workaround for a problem I (krancour) cannot pin down. The
      # linter works flawlessly in all environments (containers included)
      # EXCEPT a container in Circle. I've remoted into running containers in
      # Circle and have attempted, at great length, to diagnose the issue, but
      # am unable to do so. What I did discover, however, was that by
      # re-installing gometalinter (and the linters it, in turn, uses), I can
      # make the problem go away. ODDLY, when comparing the binaries that were
      # included in the image to the NEW binaries, diff says they are identical.
      # I'm at a complete loss for why this happens. I can live with this
      # workaround for now because I anticipate our days using Circle for CI
      # are numbered anyhow.
